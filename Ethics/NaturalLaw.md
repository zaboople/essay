# Natural Law

The idea of a "Natural Law" is ancient, about as old as philosophy and religion themselves, although various characters took liberties with it, because science took a long time to secure a proper footing. Many folks saw Natural Law as some idea of incontrovertible morals encoded into nature. "Natural Rights" comes along with.

If we to say to a moralist, "There's no such thing as a free lunch," they might say, "That's a fine moral truth about earning what you get." However, if we hand the same aphorism to a *physicist*, they might say, "That's an excellent introductory statement to the laws of thermodynamics and conservation." These laws specify the boundaries that *reality* itself works within, and how nature's books get balanced, so that nobody and no thing gets anything (including information) for free.

This juxtaposition of agreement between intellectually distant parties is not a coincidence, or a play on words. It's quite literal: Our fundamental morality is reality itself. Being disconnected from reality, at odds with it, distorting it, is moral bankruptcy. All of reality is *nature*, not just the pretty parts in the advertisements. Radioactive plutonium is *nature*, dangerous and "synthetic" as it may be, and a clear example of how emphatically nature enforces its own laws, like a stern & ruthless god that does not suffer fools.

There has always been some idea that nature is a *divine reflecting pool*. Certainly if there are gods that make laws, nature's law would be among them. Hugo Grotius - a devout Catholic, but also an attorney - famously insisted that not even God would violate his/her own laws, and that those laws do not require God to even exist, a doctrine known as "etiamsi daremus Deum non esse". Grotius is only one of a long line of thelogians including Plato, Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Aquinas and more to investigate ideas about morality and natural law.

In this sense science eventually begins as at least an intuitively quasi-religious/moral undertaking.

## Aspiring to Nature

As an extension of our basal, absolute morality of natural law, we might form an intuition that we should aspire to "Do what is most natural" and seek some sort of "harmony" with nature. Indeed we have done this, and marketing departments everywhere have taken notice. Not only will we purchase first the potato chips marketed as "all-natural", but we might even pay more for them. Are potato chips healthy food? Well, maybe they could be morally superior food, of a sort.

Looking at the hottest hot-button moral debates, human reproduction appears again and again. We see a most-natural path of male-female sexuality and reproduction, and are often offended by any corruption of this, be it abortion, homosexuality, and then some. We are inclined to say that what nature wants - more babies - is the will of God as well. Then is in-vitro fertilization immoral, or delivery by caesarian section? Is medical intervention in any form "unnatural"?

Some will claim that it is acceptable to violate the dictum of "most natural" as long as we do it to fulfill an overriding mandate: Nature wants us to survive and reproduce, doesn't it? However, if you say to nature, "I'm sorry, but obligated as I am to survive, I've decided I'd rather not," what does nature say back? "Give me five minutes." Nature has all sorts of ways to kill you.

Nature only makes rules about how we fit within the world around us; we are not so much entitled to *violate* those rules as to work within their boundaries, being careful of side effects and accidental consequences of what we do. We will still be quick to condemn mistakes about those consequences as moral failure, because they basically are.

Our intuition, especially as westerners, of a most natural and thus most moral truth remains, and is worth understanding, even if it can lead to irrational answers, specifically *because* we need to understand our own thinking in order to correct it.

## The Lie of Human Unnaturalness

Folks tend to talk about humanity as almost separate from nature, an alien visitor of some kind, with the phrase "man-made" representing an idea of "unnatural". Human beings have extraordinary and dangerous power to manipulate nature, but we also *are* nature itself, as inevitable as frogs or black holes. You are the universe looking at itself.

It seems as if the "man vs. nature" split might owe in part to our mysticism and religion, our culture of the human as having some divine connection. If you think of yourself as having a soul, some supernatural thread connecting you to a world beyond this one, you're welcome to it, but for right now you are definitively *here* and part of this everything all around you, this weird universe. Whatever mysterious divinity has decided to put you here, it has woven you intricately into the fabric of existence and life.

## A Psychological & Social Nature

Our mental nature is wholly part of our biological nature, and would form a sense of scientific, natural law, if only we could gain some certainty about our psychology. If our health is a moral exchange for survival, our mental health is just as much a moral guideline. To traumatize and damage one's mental health is seen as moral failure.

We are also *social* beings, compelled to some sort of give-and-take social contract among peers with respect to our mental and physical well-being; so antisocial behavior is immoral behavior. But who is in charge of the contract? Everybody and nobody - the process is organic, with democracy, civil/criminal law and so forth as reasonable arbiters, and it's altogether decidedly *messy*; absolutes are hard to come by, and everybody wants to get their way.

Is our resulting social morality *arbitrary*, though? Is it merely a function of who has the most power, that even criminal guilt is just a matter of how wealthy and politically well-connected you are or aren't? Actually we have to think of power not only in the concentrated elitist but broadly populist form; our failure to balance the two will lead to all sorts of violence. Still, the psychology research and even just anecdotal experience will inevitably force us to recognize that a lot more folks want to follow orders, and a much smaller bunch want to give them. After all: Leaders get most of the blame.

In fact there seems to be a widespread misapprehension of how the social contract is constructed and *architected*, as if our use of *hierarchy* is a reprehensible and disgusting *oppression* - arguably not. Anthropological research of idealized anarchist societies is always conducted with primitive peoples living in small communities, but we live in large technology-based societies. We are intuitively inclined towards an asymmetric architecture *not* because it consolidates power for the sake of power itself, but that it creates stability in the whole. *Power is a two-way street*. The broadly populist will potentially get fed up with the abusive elite, kill them outright, then launch into fluid waves of genocidal rampage in the absence until things recrystallize and stabilize.

If you happen to be part of a concentrated elite, with the infernal, invisible sword of Damocles hanging overhead, you might notice that you are mostly an ordinary jerk endowed with a popular mythology of extraordinary genius and physical sturdiness that exceeds yourself, and it makes you a bit nervous, because it darn well ought to. If you're approximately halfway as smart as anyone thinks, however, you know that structural integrity compels structural flexibility, that excessive rigidity yields brittleness, that otherwise impressively towering and seemingly infallible structures will collapse in spectular fashion without. You'd strongly suggest we allow some rotation and upwards/downwards mobility within the hierarchy rather than insisting you be emperor until death so that you aren't compelled to end up dead much sooner than you'd prefer.

If you insist on some kind of one-dimensional ladder that you expect to magically stand on end forever, you're going to achieve anything but. The human social contract is multi-dimensional, which is to say there is not a singular summary measurement of character and strength - or worse yet, "genius" - where each is assigned a permanent position at birth and ever after. There are many domains of excellence and leadership in which to achieve and build up the whole, flexibly.

Overall, you are in fact observing nature at work in this political science, the same physical principles of structure in nature applied to the social contract of human nature, diabolical and prone to hubris as the balancing act might be. As heuristics go, if there is balance compelled, nature is afoot.

# The Altruistic Mandate

Suppose a person is doing The Right Thing, and we ask them: Why? "Well, because I have a mandate from God."

"Okay, but you also like doing this sort of thing, right? In some way it gives you good feelings, maybe?"

"No, I hate every minute of it. But I have to do it." Is this person immoral, because of how they *feel*, or at least less moral than the good-feeling do-gooder? Of course not. We wrap up too much *feeling* in morality, and since we will always have performative morality, there is nothing more annoying than a person letting us know how much feeling they feel when doing good as prominently and publicly as they can, hoping to gain our admiration. Just do the right thing and get it done, kids. That's how mandates work.

Still, it helps to have a rational basis, and altruism itself is perfectly rational, given that we are social beings and helping one another is innate to our nature. It might well be that it makes you feel better - or at least *proper* - even without making a big media production of it. Furthermore, contributing to the stabilization of less fortunate corners of society is a perfectly rational thing to do, given that the destabilization is so irrational.

If you insist that your God is the ultimate arbiter of good, well, if God creates the rational world, you'd be right on target. Certainly your God would be mistaken to insist on a morality that forces actions that His creation deems so irrational that you end up in an epic and most likely losing fight with nature, within you or without.

Still, even death as self-sacrifice for the good of another can be the rational thing to do, as long as most of us aren't doing it, for the moral hazard that there's nobody left to bicker about the whole thing, and of course there'd have to be at least a handful of anothers left to benefit from the good.

## Can We Become Truly Moral Without Religion?

Shall I smugly insist that my education & faith in God has made me morally superior to the unwashed atheists around me? Bleagh. Things are hard enough already without trying to prove *that*.

It isn't so much that faith in God is *necessary* to get by and hopefully thrive as a society, but that it is part of what we *are*, simply, our nature - and becomes part of our moral obligation when it arises within us. We should try understand it and use it appropriately.

## Automatic Moralities

Sometimes we propose moral systems like laissez-faire capitalism or some extreme forms of utilitarianism, in which individuals play an amoral game and attempt to get the highest score. We're told that the system excuses us from moral concerns by magically self-correcting for right and wrong. Any system of "automatic morality" like this is always morally disastrous, because morality is an individual responsibility requiring individual conscience and great effort.

Certainly our social systems of law, achievement, wealth and so forth ought to permit and even encourage us towards morally acceptable behavior. However, if I create a game, you'll notice ways to cheat at that game, and the most dangerous thing is for both of us to insist that it is un-cheatable.

Going back to religion, not even religion is an automatic morality, and great horror ensues when we insist that it is. Beware this.

Nature *is* the ultimate automatic morality: As long as we act with respect to natural consequences, we are doing good. We might want to be careful about time, however, because sometimes the consequences appear long after the actions.

## Delusion

Instead of tying yourself in knots about "the moral good that nature wants", a much more important moral directive is to stay connected to reality instead of distorting it into delusion. Most people think that's easy and ridicule the idea of delusion, but if you observe those same people, it obviously *isn't* easy, because people fall into delusional habits all the time, even the very highest-IQ people, who get trapped for two reasons:

1) They assume that they are the most objective, rational, scientific and logical just for the asking, rather than recognizing these things require persistent effort, and acceptance of the most hated thing: You're going to be wrong, a lot. Arrogance then becomes a substitute for accuracy.

2) The truth is generally easy, because it supports itself without your help. Lying is the hard part, and requires extraordinary intelligence to fool the listener into not noticing the lie. The very best liars believe their own lies, and that's how we get to delusion.

And yet: It is *imagination* where true genius lies. This is the part of us that dabbles in the unreal, bridging a gap to the real, making possible what seemed impossible. Should we despise it because it's really no different from delusion? Are you an innovative genius or a delusional crank? It depends on whether your idea works or not.

In the end, we have to *balance* the real with the unreal, making sure we know exactly how things are, but challenging ourselves to look for more.
