# Morality Basketball

If we're playing basketball, and you say, "I hear you can't make the three point shot," what do I say?

"Leave me open and see what happens, fool!" Then I run by the bench and hiss, "Coach! They know I can't hit threes!"

In morality basketball, there are no baskets or balls; it's *all* trash-talking. The winner is whoever gets ejected first, or maybe last - hard to say. It's the only game that's as exhausting to watch as it is to play, while still putting you at risk for heart disease and other ailments. Be you atheist, agnostic, or deist, playing morality basketball is playing to lose the game of life. It's very popular.

There's also morality sailing, where a rising tide lifts all boats. Everyone is bad at it, and hardly anyone plays, but it's a good game, and there's always fresh air. We can ride in circles around one another, or race to a destination, but it's always worthwhile.
