# Free Will Part IV: Exhaustion

I've spent some time wrapped up in the controversy of "free will". It's a foundational, essential concept that your intuition readily affirms, that religion typically makes implicit, and that many atheists will also affirm, including prominent philosophers. It's necessary for basic self-respect and respect for others.

In other words, free will is grade-school arithmetic, except we have a problem: A small but sizeable minority of educated, credentialed, prominent and popular intellectuals will firmly deny it even exists, or undermine it so badly with doubletalk that everyone is confused and just shrugs. Imagine teaching all of mathematics like this, so that something like subtraction would be considered a controversy, sometimes infused with political turmoil and rage. Imagine the riots over pi...

I've realized there are somewhat popular ways of thinking that chip away at everything real, layer by layer, until we perceive *all* as illusion. A perhaps incomplete, agnostic catalog of things to destroy would be:

- Free Will
- Consciousness
- Self
- Humanity
- Life
- Death
- Science
- Time
- The Universe
- Truth
- Reality itself
- *(You can add God if you want to)*

Most of us are taking these realities on some small measure of *faith*, aren't we? We certainly have physical evidence, but we also just *want to be real*. I could demand that you prove you have a right to think that you are real, but most people would think I'm a colossal jerk, because they are decidedly biased in favor of what gives you courage to continue; a few go the other way, for various reasons.

Yet again comes the reminder that compassion is not just pity for the helpless, but an effort to help them gain control of their lives, i.e. empowerment. It's a good litmus test for our views on religion, ethics and politics. I can argue that atheism conquers the boogeyman of superstition and gives you that empowerment, but not if we have to fight a lengthy and brutal battle just to prove that it's acceptable to want to be real, free and honorable, among other things.

I'm not even passing judgement on that theism question, but attempting to establish that it's not enough to insist on unconditional faith in "truth", because truth is incredibly hard. We have to first insist on unconditional faith in a meaningful life as a necessity we can agree on and defend relentlessly, and to let the cynics question our authenticity without fear that they would consume us.
