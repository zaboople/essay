# You Can Have Free Will

The familiar and popular argument against free will goes roughly as: First we assert that the universe is perfectly deterministic, which is to say, based on cause-and-effect; things happen as a consequence of other things, and if you can measure the right parts of a system, you can predict what that system will do. Then we see that it is as if the history of the universe is already written, because whatever happens is a direct causal outcome of what came before it, leading all the way to the end of history, if there is one. Given that this history is for all intents and purposes a settled matter, we can say that every decision you make is the only decision you *can* make, and so: *You have no free will*.

How does this argument against free will make you feel - as if someone cut your legs out from under you? In fact we've attacked your most fundamental sense of value, in both yourself and others. Many people find it very depressing, even to the point of personal crisis, and I don't want that. To find a fix, I'd like to look at free will from a perspective of *value*, because  that value matters most. Many would say free will is really about *moral responsibility*, which is true, but my objective is not a stick to beat others with, for their failure. I want life to be worth living again, assuming a utilitarian pseudo-utopia of hedonic pleasures isn't enough.

People often try to defend free will by refusing determinism, per "libertarian" reasoning (unrelated to political libertarians). I am taking the "compatibilist" route, which is to say I'm okay with determinism; chaotic randomness comes into play, however, so one might complain that I'm trying to sneak in some libertarian logic. I won't be fooling around with quantum mechanics, synaptic goings-on, or anything religious per se.

## Starting With Common Sense

First, a question: Does *trust* mean anything to you? How much does trust define your sense of value, in yourself or myself? Trust is one of the most valuable commodities we know of. However, for me to earn your trust is for me to be *deterministic*, to be predictable: You've learned that you can certainly rely on me to do as I promised. But wait! We just decided that I am *perfectly* deterministic already - why would this trust be of such *immense* value then? Furthermore, should I stop being trustworthy to gain back my treasure of "free will"? Goodness no. Something doesn't make sense here. Rather than being automatic, this determinism seems to require persistent effort and honesty.

Trying a slightly different tack: We're advised that you are a puppet on a string, that none of your decisions are your own; so why trouble yourself with decisions, then? You should stop worrying about decisions since they've already been made per the certainty of determinism - right? But you're not that foolish: If you give up on decision-making, your future *will* be terrible.

Another angle: The condemned criminal says, "Judge, you have no right to sentence me to prison for a crime that I had no choice but to commit in a perfectly deterministic universe!" The judge says, "Sir, you have no right to complain about a sentence that I have no choice but to render in a perfectly deterministic universe!"<sup>1</sup> We might as well play tit-for-tat-toe forever, or just accept that the criminal *can* change his mind about crime just as easily as the judge *can* change his mind about punishment. Both are equally restricted, or equally free, or equally somewhere in between. Our anti-free-will philosophy yields *nothing* of value to our actual judgement, since it is practically anti-judgement; some would say it means "Judge not, for this wasn't their fault," but in fact anti-free-will *annihilates* judgement.

I may insist to no end that my argument against free will from determinism is perfectly, logically sound, but you are entitled to insist that it leads to absurdly false conclusions. It would seem that we've wrapped ourselves up in a paradox. However, we must not reject determinism; it is the basis of a core morality, of a *truth in nature*.

Considering randomness again, should you want to be random, or at least *more* random, to recover some sense of free will? By and large, no. You live in a world that is chaotic enough already. Chaos is often described as "deterministic randomness" - a strange oxymoron - or "pseudorandomness". Chaos happens when there is enough complexity in a system to defy our ability to predict it without going to extraordinary means, but it yields results predicted by the mathematics of probability. To create chaos, we only need a pair of dice and a craps table. It's everywhere, all around us, and it *is* deterministic, but paradoxically approaches a "pure" randomness without achieving it perfectly. Your life's work is to achieve some order both within and from that chaos, using that chaos.

In the simplest universe, chaos dissipates, and life *is* pointless and predictable. What would you do there? You'd choose self-annihilation just to free yourself. Before deciding that your currently *chaotic* life has no meaning, consider how meaningless that simplest, most predictable universe is.

A simple problem: Everyone says, "Don't go to the grocery store hungry!" because you're much more likely to buy junk food. First, eat some breakfast, a sandwich, etc. We are confessing that we lack the strength of "will" alone to shop conscientiously when hungry, a loss of *control* that can be regained, however, by having a meal first. There you have it: Useful, practical advice, for once. This advice follows the pattern of, "Focus more on the things you can control, less on the things you can't." Even better! It certainly makes sense to recognize that some aspects of our behavior are difficult to control through sheer *will*. We can structure our lives and pursue various means to mitigate or even cure, and if those remedies sometimes amount to a more circumspect *will*, good enough. So, by no means is free will a *perfect* freedom of will; it is the control we have in spite of the control we haven't.

Having perhaps secured some faith in your sense of value, we can move on to hair-splitting.

## Paradox

The philosopher Zeno concocted bedeviling paradoxes about an arrow, a runner in a footrace, and then some, paradoxes that seem to indicate the arrow should not fly and the runner should not finish the race - but they do. Of course if someone shot an arrow at Zeno, he would *duck*, like any reasonable person; his point was that he lacked some knowledge or understanding which could explain things.

It is incredibly obvious that your motivation to make good decisions *matters*. Nobody needs to tell you that. Acting as if you are merely an observer tagging along for the ride of history will get you in big trouble. If paradox says otherwise, paradox can ride in the back seat. Paradox declaims the incompleteness of our understanding, not the truth itself.

To understand our free will paradox better, first understand what science does: It does not compel or yield perfect omniscience; instead, science allows us to use imperfect understanding, imperfect information, imperfect theory and even imperfect calculation to *predict* an outcome with reasonable accuracy - and it works. Ultimately, science is for pragmatists, not perfectionists.

The free will antagonist is just as antagonistic to science itself: I insist that your entire life is perfectly predictable, but when you ask for that prediction, I refuse, and say, "Well, I could if I was omniscient!" But I'm not! No actual prediction is made, and no new information is revealed, just a claim of "I could." Nothing of scientific usefulness is revealed because no science is being conducted here. *I am claiming unttainable prediction - on the condition of unattainable knowledge*. I can claim just as much value from an infinity of nothing. If instead a doctor used real science like psychology and/or neurology to explain and predict some of your behavior, they would be accomplishing something; ideally, they'd help you remedy problems, gain *control* of your life, and effectively improve your free will.

Suppose I construct an omniscience machine<sup>2</sup>, a contraption of extraordinary power that is able to generate theories and predictions of the future, more and more of them pouring out in the machine's readout at astonishing speed, rapidly approaching omniscience. Conscious beings read all of this, and say, "Ah! We can take advantage of this new information!" These people will therefore affect the future, and that information must be considered by my OM. Now we have a feedback loop, where I have to crank the OM harder & harder because every bit of new knowledge about the future affects the future. I've created the ultimate game-theory nightmare. Arguably, some of the people will commit suicide rather than experience the future revealed; this creates a new future for everyone else, and a new pool of potential suicide committers. Do we eventually end up with our entire population dead? Maybe my machine will explode and/or use up all available energy first.

Who is Zeno, and who is the archer? Who is saying "Your arrow can't possibly fly"?

The universe that gives you determinism also refuses to give you omniscience, as if one fact is conditioned on the other. Perhaps our free will paradox might help us arrive at some greater theory of information, causality and otherwise some day, but it will never get us to the forbidden ground of omniscient prediction. If the history of the world is already written, it is locked away where we can never get to *most* of it - only some - and for all practical purposes that "most" doesn't exist - as *impractical* purposes go, those can wait for you to recover your self-esteem.

## An Attempt At Real Perspective

We live in a strange universe that confronts us with the unfathomability of existence. At smaller, more pragmatic scales we can find meaning and create order, but at the greatest scales this approaches impossibility. This forms a complimentary contradiction to our deterministic intentions. Some people use this as an excuse to become nihilistic. Reasonable people learn to accept and balance the burden, knowing they have much work to do. They can render this as religious faith if they like, and some would insist, some shrug, some scoff.

Rational understanding and action is part of your intrinsic value; doing the "right" thing means doing the "smartest" thing means doing the "deterministic" thing, which is to say, your actions are ideally predictable rather than random. Of course we cannot predict your actions perfectly unless we have the same information as you, and your actions will be imperfect because you and your information are imperfect. There will be quite a bit of chaotic serendipity, in which accidents yield innovations. Imperfection abounds, and any proper artist sees beauty in that. The imperfection of perspective makes you an individual instead of an indistinguishable part of an omnipresent entity.

To be perfectly irrational is to be perfectly doomed; but to be perfectly rational & deterministic in any pragmatic sense is unnecessary, counterproductive, and impossible to begin with. We have to balance rationality with imperfection and the unfathomability of existence.

Rather than obsessing over free will, obsess over *value*. How do you become a person of great value? Start with the rational, deterministic things: Be smart, observant, knowledgeable, reliable, meaningful. Move on to imperfection: Be open-minded, flexible, forgiving. Finally: Embrace the unfathomability as how things are meant to be, whatever that might mean, and make the most of it.
