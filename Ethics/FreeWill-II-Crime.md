# Free Will Part II: Crime & Punishment

Rejecting free will rejects moral responsibility, so proponents tend to claim the gain of a virtuous *forgiveness*, almost as if they invented it or at least cornered the market. This forgiveness becomes as meaningless as what it forgives - not virtuous, but obligatory, the kind of forgiveness we would give a wild animal for attacking us - and then kill it. It's an attempt to reject moral virtue and immediately reach for it again, saying, "The right thing to do is give up on doing the right thing." This pseudo-forgiveness is not interested in reforming the individual forgiven; instead it wants to take away their freedom, designating them as incapable of self-control. Authoritarian government rests on a condescending pity and contempt for the individual, disguised as compassion.

As a proper advocate for free will and criminal justice, you recognize my liberty, and when I act wrong, you demand punishment, but you don't seek *revenge*, because revenge is pointless. Instead, you appeal to my deterministic side, making sure that I recognize the crime isn't worthwhile and that I have better choices available. So, criminal justice done properly seeks three fairly obvious things:

1) Reform the perpetrator;
2) Discourage and disencentivize would-be perpetrators;
3) Prevent the unreformed from doing further harm.

None of those compel retribution as an ideal, even when they compel punishment. Forgiveness is already the moral ideal. We don't need to destroy anyone's sense of *individuality* and *liberty* as casualties in the death of free will for the sake of killing retribution as well. Neither does the assertion of free will itself compel retribution, even though it insists that the perpetrator was capable of choosing to avoid crime.

A truly free society *demands* an acknowledgement of free will from its citizens, because it demands responsible action in exchange for the freedom granted. Why be free if you have no free will? *Real* forgiveness is an absolutely worthy virtue, but one that rests on a principle of individual change, that a person can become better and overcome the mistakes they've made.

Of course there are cases where physical and/or psychological trauma results in a person who is unable to behave normally and cannot be trusted, even with therapeutic intervention, and that means permanent and expensive incarceration, often in a mental health institution rather than a prison, although the differences are often minimal. We certainly ought to make sure it is not the institution itself causing the trauma, though.

We can buy into this criminal justice ideology as strictly selfish and even atheist people if we really want to; it doesn't matter. It's in your best interest to construct a law-abiding social order where you can freely exchange with others. The principles of criminal justice herein fall largely in line with the original thinking of Bentham's Utilitarian philosophy, which sought to remove retribution/revenge from criminal justice (Bentham was also profoundly atheist, but that part is strictly optional).
