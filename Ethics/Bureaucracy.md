# A Tale Of Two Bureaucrats

## First, a Play

Bob: Man, I hate bureaucracy!

Alice: Oh yeah, me too!

Bob: I know, right? Like when I'm like, "Hey, man, I could use a hand here," and somebody's all like, "Sorry, that's not my job, not my department," you know? The left hand never knows what the right is doing! Things fall between the cracks!

Alice: Yeah, like you can't even tie your shoes without approval from the shoe-tying committee! Everybody's in everybody else's business! As soon as you get something going, ten different people come to explain why you can't!

*A brief pause while Bob stares at Alice...*

Bob: Wait.

Alice: What?

Bob: Are we talking about the same thing?

What _is_ a bureaucrat, anyhow? A devil's dictionary might say, "Everyone else." Nobody's going to say, "I really like bureaucracy!" Perhaps the all-encompassing definition is: _A bureaucrat is someone who tries to help when nobody needs them, and/or can't be bothered when somebody does_.

Then again, big problems require big organizations, and big organizations require *some* kind of bureaucracy to function. You can be the small-company-only kind of person who sneers at this, but be thankful for the people who make it possible and the benefits you enjoy from such.

## Empowerment and Collaboration

A good organization needs two core values: *Empowerment* and *Collaboration*. The catch is that these are contradictory.

*Empowerment* moves authority down the hierarchy into the hands of individuals and small teams, allowing them to act decisively with minimal interference. You will always find that good people seek empowerment and are willing to earn it by demonstrating their competency - not necessarily so they can tell others what to do, but so they can have some authority over *themselves*.

*Collaboration* recognizes that only so much can be accomplished by individuals and small teams. It requires empathy and negotiation skills. Especially important is *interdisciplinary* collaboration, where we need to work with people who have different skillsets and backgrounds.

In our story, Bob feels that collaboration has been sacrificed for the sake of empowerment, resulting in an organization of silos where people work at cross-purposes and don't communicate. Alice feels instead that empowerment has been sacrificed for the sake of collaboration, resulting in an organization where there is too much interference and innovation is squashed.

Simply going to war against "silos" or alternatively against "meddling" are one-dimensional views of a two-dimensional problem. A healthy organization needs people who can work across domains of responsibility and ensure that the left hand has a necessary knowledge of what the right hand is doing; it also needs to empower individuals and small organizational units to act decisively, responsibly and accountably. Collaboration and empowerment might be opposites, but they are complementary values, not antagonistic ones.

## The Generational Shift

Unfortunately you will tend to see generational imbalance in the tech business: In the 1990's, Generation-X-led organizations were very pro-empowerment and anti-collaboration; but after the turn of the century, Millenials pushed the pendulum firmly in the opposite direction. You'll notice this with a popular but nonsensical job interview question: "Do you prefer to work alone or with other people?"

Back in the 1990's, if I said, "Well, I'm a people person, a collaborator. I know I can't do everything myself. I'm happy to help others and be helped," then the interviewer would write down:

- Can't stand on his own two feet
- Not a self-starter
- Wants others to do his work for him

Not good. Since around 2010 or so, if I walk into an interview and say, "I don't need a lot of hand-holding. I'm more than happy to take on a big responsibility and be accountable for its outcome as well," then the interviewer will write down:

- Doesn't get along with others
- Not a team player
- Likely source of friction

As explained already, it's all a nonsensical trap posed by gatekeepers who think they're capable of filtering for "good" vs. "bad". It's best to just explain the balance and refuse to commit to one side or the other: Nobody works in a vacuum, so you have to work with other people, and balance your own desire for empowerment with collaborative skills that make it easier to deal with others as needed.
