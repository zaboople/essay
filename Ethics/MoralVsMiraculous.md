# The Moral Versus the Miraculous

A mainstream religion like Christianity, Judaism, etc. has to deal with a fundamental conflict: What is moral is generally not miraculous. If God miraculously provides your sustenance, why would you need to go out and work for it? But what is the point of worshipping a God who does practically nothing while you sweat out the hard parts yourself? The audience comes to hear of miracles, but bends to the will of moral reminders stubbornly. This is a manageable conflict, yes, but it guides the religious narrative like a river seeking low ground, and requires a certain balance.

An utterly irrational religion comes into conflict with our moral responsibilities and makes a mess out of everything; it will only exist as a *cult*, wallowing in contradiction, shrieking for obedience. A truly minimalist religion need only confront the miraculous irrationality of our existence, but nobody's keeping score as long as moral truths remain sound. A few Virgin Maries with chronic allergy symptoms aren't hurting anyone, and even a story as strange as the life of Christ is just fine; strange doesn't prove false, after all, and Christianity has successfully (mostly) adapted to modernity.

For these reasons the more successful churches tend to succeed as much on helping community members with marriage, child-rearing, finance, job-seeking, food and other mundane matters, every bit as much on the divine and glorious aspects; neither of which needs be mutually exclusive with the other. In times like the present, when people tend towards cynical & resentful atheism, moral teaching as practical assistance becomes a way to rebuild faith.

So the practice of religion proper is a moral practice of Doing The Right Thing(s), which is a rational process of making sense of one's place in the world. Done properly, this making of sense becomes the value held utmost, so that one's mission is to gain deeper and deeper understanding, until: Why are we even here? There is no certain answer to that question, only the desire that there *should* be one, acceptance of this, and thus, faith - or not. Nothing is compulsory, just available. Of course moral perfection itself remains fleeting and remote, not a precondition.

Thus moral truth becomes more the pathway to God than the other way around. You might prefer to think of the two forming sides of a circle, where each leads to the other, which seems fine as well; but would you refuse moral truth to someone on condition of them first accepting your vision of the divine?

If someone denies moral truth and declares all morals to be arbitrary, mere convention, then we can be certain they will never seek the divine, in faith, in God. Those things become inconceivable. They did not reject God; they rejected truth.
