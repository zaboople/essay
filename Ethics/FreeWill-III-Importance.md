# Free Will Part III: Why This Is So Important

Understand that free will is about much more than "moral responsibility": meaning, trust, respect, purpose, duty, honor, even sacrifice; about your life being worthwhile, even in hardship. What is there to be admired in endurance when you have no choice whatsoever, only to endure, having not even the voluntary will to survive? How *does* one survive a meaningless life?

## Nobody Looks Good Here, But Some Look Awful

There seem to be three kinds of people arguing against free will:

The first kind see it as their scientific duty to Set Things Straight, steadfastly, stubbornly refusing to brook any protest. "No, no, no! It is done and settled. No such thing exists! My science is unassailable." They don't mean any harm, though; they just think they have Great and Certain Truth, and a moral instinct kicks in: Great and Certain Truth must not be denied! Then comes the realization that maybe they've smashed a moral foundation of some sort, so they try to find some logical duct tape and spackle to repair it with. Well, this is a challenging problem to work on, and mistakes are made, and it's possible I've misread them somewhat. I'd advise them to be careful of creating fog on a dangerous road.

The second kind of person has become preoccupied with spite, and it's fairly evident from their words. This person appears mostly on the internet, anonymously, and perhaps they've had a bad day, or year, or more. You can engage with them or just avoid them. I'll accuse them of being kind enough to make it easy for any adult to read their intentions.

The *third* kind of person is the least common. They mean to destroy your free will and grind it into powder. They are good at getting lots of media attention, presenting themselves as smart, persuasive and authoritative. The disturbing part is how they emphasize *compassion*, announcing, "Fear not! Nobody can ever be blamed for anything ever again! Nothing is your fault, forevermore." They go on to present an image of the kindest person making their gentlest, most patient effort to help and guide the listener or reader to a most-moral conclusion - actually a *post-moral* one.

The most terrifying movie monster is the one that disguises themselves as a caring friend, to gain the victim's confidence - then blowtorches their soul with glee. You can insist I've watched too many of those movies. Still, I have seen evidence of a small number of innocent people who are lacking just enough in conviction that they fall into a trap that becomes a spiral of despair. People get hurt.

Why would someone claiming the best of intentions seek to destroy your humanity in scorched-earth fashion, yanking your free will out from under you, watching you drop straight into a bottomless pit at terminal velocity, shouting down at you, "I'm doing you a big favor, you know!" How could anyone mistake this idea of all-sins-forgiven as a ham-fisted replica of Christianity Without the Annoying God Parts for anything less than an emotional death sentence? What kind of delusional, head-smacking madness is this?

Of course being a free speech advocate, I agree that when an enchanter's tricks are exposed to the broad light of day, they stop working, and all the enchanters walk away.

## A Double-Dare

Suppose it is our task to give the eulogy for a great hero who sacrificed themselves for the sake of others. Perhaps we might  say, "Well, this person's courage in the face of great danger and hardship was actually not a choice, so they're really a victim and we should feel sorry for them." We could try to speak of an "instinctive heroism", crediting everyone else for one person's real actions. Maybe we could even talk about heroic acts of self-sacrifice that animals sometimes engage in, so as to drain humanity from our vision completely.

The audience would hate us for all of that, of course.

It seems that heroic figures sometimes speak of discomfort with their celebrated status, because they tend to think of their actions as strict duty, what one *must* do, a necessity without any real alternative, arguably without free will. However I think they mean that the alternative is in their eyes a cowardice, a negligence they could not live with, that the peers and predecessors they respect would just as readily reject, and recognize as contempt. There *is* a second choice, but it abdicates moral responsibility. It's not a contradiction that free will often finds one acceptable choice instead of many.

So we speak highly of heroic figures because they remind us of duty compelled by our own free will, and that we are all *capable* of summoning such courage, because this one person did so. That should be no surprise.

Still, speaking justly to heroism is a complicated needle to thread. Of course dictators, monarchs, and so forth give out medals - sometimes to themselves and cronies. I don't think this ruins our respect for duty, but any good thing can be corrupted, and dysfunctional government can have its few saving graces. Anyhow, I hope I've done justice to a difficult subject, and my apologies if I messed it up.

Good luck writing your speech.
