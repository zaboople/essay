# Moral Storytelling

When we pose the question, "What's the moral of the story?" we're using a form of shorthand where "moral" is short for "moral lesson". Of course the answer is often, "It doesn't have one." Stories that try to push a specific moral lesson tend to come off heavy-handed and preachy - maybe better left for children, or maybe no one at all.

However: All interesting stories have a *moral arc*. If you want people to like your story, get excited about it, recommend it to their friends, and so on, you better figure out that moral arc or you'll get nowhere with your audience - instead they may well hate you for it.

The phrase "moral arc" is my fancy way of saying: Characters make decisions; those decisions lead to action or the lack thereof; and that has consequences. A good story might feature evil characters making evil decisions, but the consequences are only suffered by innocent people, and that's fine; the key concept is that the *consequences* make sense, and *somebody* had to deal with them.

The audience might prefer that there are consequences for the evil character, even if it's just that nobody trusts her, and/or she ends up drinking a lot of booze to dissolve guilt, or what-have-you. Still, it's not required that living by the sword requires specifically dying by the sword. The subtlety of consequences is often what makes the story most intriguing.

The most popular law of physics is Newton's third law of motion: "To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction." You will notice laypersons using this completely out of context, and really, using it as a moral dictum: There will be consequences for the things you do. Also popular is the notion of a "law of unintended consequences" (also see Murphy's Law) which really isn't a scientific law, although everybody seems to think it should be. We expect story characters to try to anticipate consequences and fail, especially when doing something foolish.

Aren't we arguing that all stories *do* have moral lessons, then? We all have an idea of how the world *should* work, and how it *will* work; storytelling is about the latter. Maybe our opinions about "should" disagree with "will" because our morals are flawed - and perhaps *unrealistic* - but that's not the storyteller's problem. We'll (mostly) allow them to get away with pointing out how the world works, as they see it. The storyteller can go so far as to satirize our morals, to render them as farce, and if the story makes sense, we'll put up with it. It's like the algebra test in school, where the teacher adds the written instruction: *Show your work*. We'll give you some points for the wrong answer if your method of arriving at it is mostly correct, and we'll subtract points if you insist on giving the bad guy the business without showing us the mechanics of your judgement.

I think we do learn at least part of our moral outlook from stories, and there is a hazard afoot, where bad storytellers push their misbegotten moral arcs onto unwitting listeners. The solution is not to ban & burn, but to write more, better stories, because by and large people do respond when the story makes sense, even unconventional sense that defies moral common wisdom. The catch is that we have to be willing to listen to the story as told and not be angry that it violates stereotypes and ignores tropes - that ought to be the fun of it, after all.
