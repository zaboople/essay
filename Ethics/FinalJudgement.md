# The Fascination of Final Judgement

What has become of the shrieking, howling, caterwauling pronouncers and denouncers, apopleptic with rage and spitting disgust, knives in hand, red-faced and eyes wide, demanding appropriate prostation, groveling and apology in reply to their most abiding question: *How dare you???*

Utter silence.

Because: This is the canonical notion of Final Judgement, where you stand alone before your God at the end of all ends.

Surely this judgement includes the context of what good you've done the rest of humanity in spite of themselves, but it is not their judgement come to bear. Much as I'd like to have my say, even I become irrelevant as concerns *you* and *your* result. It is a terrifying peace.

Grandiose pronouncements of self-congratulation: Irrelevant. Prominent displays of loyal adherence: Irrelevant. Objects and books bearing claims of divine fingerprint: Irrelevant. Kingships, trophies, certificates of authenticity: Irrelevant.

You have your own legs to stand on. Wherever your doctrinal urges might originate from, they pass muster or fail on divine condition alone.

As for me? I find the thought rather humbling. I am compelled to exercise great care in advising you on this business, because of course I am just as accountable as yourself, and to wreck your destiny in addition to my own just makes things that much worse. So I consider this in absolute solitude, because that is the actual nature of it, as dissapointing as that might be to the shrieking, howling and caterwauling masses of would-be moral, scriptural, and political dicators, even if I can hear them in my sleep, even if I can barely think above the din.

Perhaps I am well-advised to be certain of my requirements and intentions, or at least be gentle in my manner of questioning, or remain silent.
