# Reality is a Jerk

I would like to offer an indictment of _Reality_. To wit:

  - Reality is indifferent
  - Reality is defiant
  - Reality is downright _arrogant_

In short, Reality is a _jerk_. Try asking him to give an inch, and he will take a yard. Reality will dig his heels in, cross his arms and tell you right to your face: _I don't even care what you think_. He just does what he pleases and answers to no one. Reality never, ever, apologizes for his rudeness and insensitivity, and sometimes refuses to even explain himself! The narcissism of Reality is utterly pathological. It's rumored that he's even murdered a few people.

My simple question for Reality is: Do you really think your incredibly rude behavior is justified? Do you honestly think you're entitled to be right about *everything*? Why?

I'll tell you this much: If it were up to me, Reality would be fired immediately! No, I don't care what he has going for him, because he has a bad attitude, and for me, bad attitudes are a big-time dealbreaker. It's a team effort, and if you can't support your team, work with your team, stick with your team through thick and thin, then you're worthless to your team, and nobody will ever want to work with you.

Instead I have to put up with Reality's utterly cavalier and dismissive meanness every single day. He doesn't care whose feelings he hurts, and yes, I have feelings too - I'm human! Aren't we all? Reality is practically *in*human.

I could have agreement from a dozen people on a great idea, and yet Reality walks in, looks at our plans, and simply declares, "Nope. Won't work." And that's it: Everybody just walks away because this one guy doesn't approve. Whatever happened to democracy?

Yes, I've asked the management, "Why do you put up with this bum?" They just shake their heads and say, "We don't have much choice..." I'm pretty sure Reality isn't even getting paid! He just shows up - in fact he's always first to arrive and last to leave. Every time I think I'm alone, I turn around, and - agh! He's just standing there, *staring*.

I suppose I should just resign myself to fate, that all my best ideas will be ruined by Reality, and there's nothing I can do about it, but it's just not fair and it never will be.
