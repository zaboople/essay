# Is Capitalism Failing?

Here are three competing (possibly naive) hypotheses:

1) Capitalism is inherently corrupt and evil; so, is it a crime to corrupt the corrupted? If the rich are evil, is it wrong to steal from the rich and give to myself? Perhaps by undermining the capitalist system - by corrupting it - I am committing a virtuous act.

2) Taking libertarian laissez-faire belief to the extreme, capitalism is an *automatic morality*. Should you express worry about your moral failings, I need only ask, "Well, are you wealthy?" If so, capitalism automatically guarantees your virtuosity, because capitalism acts as an anonymous god who punishes the wicked with poverty and bestows the blessings of wealth on the just. Wealth becomes a sign of virtue in its own right.

3) Capitalism is only an agreed-upon *system*. Like any system of agreement, if we approach it amorally, with lies, it fails under the weight of our misdeeds and our society fails with it. Even the church becomes corrupt when its leaders are corrupt. When every scene is a crime scene, there aren't enough police to patrol them all.

I embrace the 3rd hypothesis, but by the same point I think the 1st & 2nd have become popular to the point that capitalism is failing.

## David Graeber

David Graeber famously identified a phenomenon he called "bullshit jobs": When talking to white-collar people informally at parties and such, they would often describe their occupations to him as meaningless, i.e. "b.s.". It became apparent that they weren't just being humble, but that they really felt their work served no purpose.

It's important to recognize the difference between "value to society" versus "financial value": If you work for GTPI - Guns, Tobacco & Pornography Inc. - maybe all your acquaintances despise you for contributing to the moral downfall of society, while at the same time your employer draws record profits. The famous Hidden Hand of Capitalism only cares about the profits, that your work contribute to a positive bottom line. If you are subtracting from GTPI's profit, or merely failing to contribute usefully, you should and will be fired by the will of the hidden hand. However, Graeber found that this is often not the case, which is perplexing: Isn't capitalism an automatic system? When did the hidden hand become so arthritic?

We should notice that the *morality* of capitalism is not the same as our social moralities, but it is a morality nonetheless: A system with rules that must be followed, or the system fails.

## What Is Everyone Doing?

Perhaps you are actively undermining The Company because you morally despise it; or perhaps you are undermining it by pursuing foolish, delusional nonsense (politics, turf wars, etc) instead of The Company's profits. Either way, you have defied a form of moral obligation, which is that you exchange useful work for a salary in good faith. Many of us reject that notion, implicitly or explicitly, harming not only the company that employs us, but ourselves and the *people* around us: Meaningless work is self-defeating, hellish work, even if you get paid for it.

In the white-collar world, many - perhaps most - of us have lost the ability to understand any idea of ethical business. We pursue political loyalties, turf wars and institutional arrogance instead of The Company's success and the success of its customers. Some of us have pursued moral purity to the point of amoral delusion; others have pursued cynicism to the point of amoral nihilism. The idea of an honest day's work has become meaningless to the point that we'd accuse the honest day's worker of cheating or disloyalty. In an era where leadership is defined as self-righteous pandering and an absentee conscience, we shouldn't be suprised.

## Improving

First, stop pretending that you're justified in undermining a system you despise while profiting from it; just leave it behind. Perhaps you should work somewhere else, live somewhere else, or just get over it and work in good faith right & proper.

Second, stop pretending that the system excuses you from acting responsibly as long as you're profiting from irresponsible behavior. This type of behavior often will yield personal profit in the short term, even a decade and more, but it is destructive in the long term, and your job is to be concerned about that.

Third, recognize that management is about loyalty to an organization first, and to employees second, not the other way around. If that seems distasteful, recognize that "protecting my people" is a hypocritical way of saying, "protecting my position of authority and personal gain," and even moreso that keeping those people in meaningless jobs is doing them no favors whatsoever, and creating more problems for productive people who have to deal with the bureaucratic complexity caused by these folks.

Fourth, rotate upper management, which tends to reward loyalty with high-paying and meaningless appointments to reinforce itself. New leadership should be able to get rid of dead weight sub-leaders and the bureaucracy they support.

## Tech Startups

The idea of a "tech startup" is to create a company that specializes in technology innovation, usually with funding proportional to the expected profits, which are ideally astronomical. Sometimes this works out as hoped, but only if employees are actually committed to the company's ideas.

Let's propose a game, where there are a series of companies, and each company is doomed: It starts out with borrowed money, spends it and keeps borrowing, until it can't borrow anymore, and it goes out of business. You and I play the game as employees, and so our task is to hop from company to company, getting in while the getting is good - money is successfully borrowed - and getting out before it goes bad.

What is our strategy? More importantly, which is more important: my loyalty to the company,  or my loyalty to you? Obviously my loyalty to a company is not very meaningful when we know the company's going to go out of business sooner than later; but my loyalty to you outlasts the company, and helps ensure that I will help you dodge the bullet of corporate layoffs, but also to help you on board the newest, most solvent ship that just sailed in as the old one sinks. We are not concerned with what's best for the organization, but whom can I trust, and who might stab me in the back. Interpersonal loyalty can transform into a matter of ruthless intimidation and aggression towards those who have alliances outside our own club - including those who are foolishly loyal to the company.

We are playing a zero-sum game, the kind of game that attracts criminal minds. We might feign a libertarian justification that capitalism is "ruthless" and "only the strong survive", but this game isn't capitalist at all. Of course no, it wasn't anyone's intention to create this sort of game, but startup companies tend to fail, so failure is excused - even encouraged - and whoops, we've paved our road of good intentions straight to heck.

The tech startup is a strange addendum to the b.s. job phenomenology, but worth noting if you've ever been lived in a so-called "tech hub" geography and boom economy where these jobs are constantly cycling through.
