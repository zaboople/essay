# Proposal For a Constitutional Amendment to Describe Liberty

Have a look at the recent Dobbs v. Jackson Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Ignoring the abiding moral drama of the practice of abortion itself - we'll never all agree - while the method of Roe v Wade *was* unsound ("legislating from the bench" is the longstanding & valid complaint), Dobbs v. Jackson is worse: It guts the guiding principle of our democracy.

To quote Justice Alito's opinion for the majority: "The term 'liberty' alone provides little guidance. Thus, historical inquiries are essential whenever the Court is asked to recognize a new component of the 'liberty' interest protected by the Due Process Clause."

Should we rewrite Patrick Henry's words to "Give me little guidance or give me death?"

Alito justifies this lack of guidance with the claim that "liberty" is awash in hundreds of potential meanings, to the point of being meaningless. He credits the late Justice Ginsburg for a precedent that the Supreme Court must enumerate our "liberties" for us by discovering them in the roots of national "history and tradition". Alito's innovation is to declare the tradition expired as of 1868, when the 14th amendment was added as the second and last mention of due process & liberty - with the 150 years following exempt. This is utterly confounding.

Justice Thomas also made it clear in a concurring opinion that he would like to eliminate substantive due process altogether, AKA the "penumbras, formed by emanations" that make up implied liberties and rights derived from those clearly enumerated, and that have been used to strike down oppressive laws in the past.

We'd think that liberty was as simple as the freedom to do what you want to do within the bounds of due process. It was never the job of any government agent to enumerate your liberties, because the freedoms of liberty are innumerable; liberty is a *right* in and of itself. Rather, that government agent's job is to give comprehensive *reasons* for infringing upon your liberty, strictly avoiding arbitrary & capricious law. The Courts just decide if that agent met the standard.

Alito burned the most fundamental ideal of the United States of America. Was that worth it, for abortion, and only to negate universal legality of it? How could anything be worth that price? Should we copy & paste the 14th into a 28th amendment just so we can ask the court to tell us the meaning of liberty since the age of Jim Crow? Thank goodness for the 13th, else human slavery would be a traditional liberty. Alito could have just complained about Roe v. Wade as legislation like everyone else, but he insisted on being "novel", so to speak.

If the court is so timid as to be paralyzed in the absence of specifics, let them demand specific enumeration of *limits* to be effected against liberty by due process, not the other way around.

I am not advocating for some "living constitution" or "evolving liberty" and have no idea what that kind of language is supposed to mean either. Is liberty "alive"? It's what life is *about*. It is a fundamental principle of our democracy, and it was *affirmed* in 1868; Alito would have you think it was *abandoned*. It is high time we reaffirm this principle, now and forever, and as a matter of fact, yes, in the exact same tradition that the early founders embraced. Their mistake was to think the word itself was sufficient, and Supreme Court precedent officially now says otherwise. That precedent will have damaging effects forevermore, until remedied.

We need a constitutional amendment to set the definition of "liberty" explicitly, right and proper, in stone, and thus hold all the courts' feet to the fire. I've written my own version and attached it below, as a start.

Would such a liberty amendment force the courts to universally legalize abortion again? It might compel a revisiting of that debate, but not an outcome, and while the court might occasionally flip, it absolutely hates to flop. If I wanted to legalize abortion, I would propose an abortion amendment outright. Until then, courts will decide on the outcome they like, then torture the law until it expels something expedient. Either way, that debate is for another day.

Given that Alito claims "hundreds" of liberties, am I missing some subtle extra-liberty that was previously implied? If I am, then I'm happy to see it constitutionally enumerated as well, now or later. However, given that "liberty" currently means nothing whatsoever, we ought take action. Now is the time to do the dirty work of clearly defining things rather than relying on a court that is more than a little capricious, arbitrary, and political. So:

--------------------------------------------------------

The constitution is amended to read LIBERTY, retroactively and permanently, to include:

Citizens of the United States are entitled the freedom to do anything they wish to do, traditional or novel, confined only by the due process of law; so that no government body may restrict individual or collective freedom with arbitrary and capricious laws, demands or orders, executive or otherwise.

This LIBERTY is guaranteed as a right of every citizen of the united states.

It is not within any government agent's domain to enumerate and grant freedoms and liberties, because they are infinite; they are only empowered to enumerate specific and acceptable reasons for restricting rights, freedoms and liberties, as law. When necessary and timely the constitution will be amended to include specific RIGHTS, to halt illegal infringement upon the people's LIBERTY.
