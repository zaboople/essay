# An Introduction, Or: Moral Decline Is Not A Perpetual Motion Machine

In order, I am each of these: idiot, pragmatist, individualist, heretic, and balancing act. In line with those ideals, I have created some essays generally related to "ethics" here. Everything is written from an agnostic standpoint, but the influence & example of religion is unavoidable. If this work is off-putting to you, well, *you* try writing about such things without appearing to be either a nihilistic jerk *or* a sanctimonious holy roller; and yet it's a very reasonable project, to simply try not to dictate, but to *come to terms with* the big picture of right and wrong.
