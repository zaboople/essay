# An Introduction, Or: Moral Decline Is Not A Perpetual Motion Machine

In order, I am each of these: idiot, pragmatist, individualist, heretic, and balancing act. In line with those ideals, I have created some essays generally related to "ethics" here. Everything is written from an agnostic standpoint, but the influence & example of religion is unavoidable. There isn't any embrace of extremist political views.

This all may well be one of the ultimate bad ideas. It seems like a very reasonable project to try to come to terms with the big picture of right and wrong, but it's actually hard to do without appearing to be either a nihilistic jerk *or* a sanctimonious holy roller. I'm allowing myself to be messy, but hopefully not too condescending, insensitive or outright rude.
