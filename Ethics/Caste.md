# Caste

In any caste system, the first priority of the upper caste is moral & intellectual superiority, especially a greater self-control and self-awareness. They wish for the lower caste to be considered impulsive and incapable of resisting instinctive, animal urges, especially violence, sexual impropriety, intoxication and risk-taking.

So, a trade is necessary: The upper caste agrees to put up with being stifled, stilted and stultified in an attempt to prove superiority by resisting the baser impulses of the lower, who are encouraged to be much more expressive, emotionally, physically, and otherwise; of course the lower caste comes up short everywhere else, but in terms of sheer expressiveness they come out way ahead. *Impulsiveness* alone proves the case for inferiority, even the impulse to express feelings passionately and colorfully, as art, even when this impulse is perfectly normal and the upper caste has become dysfunctional, not the lower. The upper  will seek out voyeuristic experiences in the lower, partly to make up for their own deprivations, also implicitly to prove their case to themselves.

The upper persuades the lower to avoid thinking for themselves, intellectually and morally; implicit and sometimes *explicit* permission is granted for irresponsible behavior. Prison is used as a system not of rehabilitation, but of conditioning persons to violence, compelling it as a means of survival.

The upper caste often resorts to pseudo-apology through *pity*. Caste panders and patronizes; it never has the respect to say, "You're capable of much more," because the upper caste doesn't believe that. The upper caste will say, "Your life is so difficult; I could never possibly understand it, even if you spent years explaining it to me," so as to wave off any hope of empathy, to render a vast, expansive canyon of impassable indifference disguised as caring. Never forget that caste is as much about snobbery and pretentious elitism as it is about veiled hatred.

Members of the lower caste are left to hate themselves and one another. The only way to break the back of the caste system is to reject self-hatred and the pandering that encourages it; and to embrace self-expression.
